# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analytics - End-to-End Data Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **business analytics solution** that analyzes pizza sales data using **Python (Pandas), MySQL, and Power BI**. The goal is to uncover key insights such as total sales, revenue trends, pizza size preferences, and peak order times to support data-driven decision-making.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python (Pandas)** – Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **MySQL** – Data querying and KPI extraction
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard for data visualization

## 📊 Key Insights & Features
✅ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Used Python and Pandas to clean raw data for accurate analysis.  
✅ **KPI Analysis with SQL:** Queried key metrics such as total sales, revenue, and pizza quantity by size and time.  
✅ **Power BI Dashboard:** Built an interactive dashboard to visualize sales trends, peak hours, and top-selling pizzas.

1. **Data Cleaning:** Run `"pizza_sales_excel_file.xlsx"` to preprocess the dataset.
2. **Database Setup:** Import the cleaned dataset into MySQL and run the queries from `"import_pizza_sales.sql"`,`"pizza_sales_analysis.sql"`,`pizza_sales_kpi.sql`,.
3. **Dashboard Analysis:** Open `pizza_sales.pbix` in Power BI to explore interactive visualizations.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Adding **predictive analytics** using machine learning.
- Enhancing dashboard interactivity with more filters.
- Expanding SQL queries for deeper insights.
